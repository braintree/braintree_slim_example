# Braintree Slim Example
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/braintree/braintree_slim_example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/braintree/braintree_slim_example)

An example Braintree integration for PHP in the Slim framework.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install composer and project dependencies:

  ```sh
  curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
  php composer.phar install
  ```

2. Copy the contents of `example.env` into a new file named `.env` and fill in your Braintree API credentials. Credentials can be found by navigating to Account > My User > View Authorizations in the Braintree Control Panel. Full instructions can be [found on our support site](https://articles.braintreepayments.com/control-panel/important-gateway-credentials#api-credentials).

3. Start server:

  ```sh
  php -S 0.0.0.0:3000
  ```

## Running tests

Integration tests make API calls to Braintree and require that you set up your Braintree credentials. You can run this project's integration tests by adding your sandbox API credentials to `.env` and calling `vendor/bin/phpunit` on the command line.

## Testing Transactions

Sandbox transactions must be made with [sample credit card numbers](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/reference/general/testing/php#credit-card-numbers), and the response of a `Braintree_Transaction::sale()` call is dependent on the [amount of the transaction](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/reference/general/testing/php#test-amounts).

## Pro Tips

- The `example.env` contains an `APP_SECRET_KEY` setting. Even in development you should [generate your own custom secret key for your app](http://docs.slimframework.com/sessions/cookies/).
